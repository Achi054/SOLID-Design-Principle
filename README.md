  # SOLID Design Principle

**SOLID** principles provide us with ways to move from tightly coupled code and little encapsulation to the much desired loosely coupled and encapsulated code. 

`SOLID` is an acronym for the following five principles:
- [Single Responsibility Principle](srp)
- [Open closed Principle](ocp)
- [Liskov substitution principle](lsp)
- [Interface Segregation Principle](isp)
- [Dependency Inversion Principle](dip)

## _Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)_<a name="srp"></a><br>
Every software module, class, struct or functions should have one responsibility.

## _Open/Closed Principle_<a name="ocp"></a><br>
Every software module, classes, methods, function etc. are open for extension, but closed for modification.

## _Liskov Substitution Principle_<a name="lsp"></a><br>
If super/derived/child class inherits from base/parent class, then all the instance of the super/derived/child class should be able to replace base/parent class.

## _Interface Segregation Principle_<a name="isp"></a><br>
client(s) should not be forced to implement interfaces they donâ€™t use.

## _Dependency Inversion Principle_<a name="dip"></a><br>
High-level class must not depend upon a low level class. They must both depend upon abstraction. Abstraction must not depend on details, rather the details must depend upon abstractions.
